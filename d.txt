Not thinking to amuse the haughty world,
having grown fond of friendship's heed,
I wish I could present you with a gage
 that would be worthier of you —
be worthier of a fine soul
full of a holy dream,
of live and limpid poetry,
 of high thoughts and simplicity.
But so be it. With partial hand
take this collection of pied chapters:
half droll, half sad,
 plain-folk, ideal,
the careless fruit of my amusements,
insomnias, light inspirations,
unripe and withered years,
 the intellect's cold observations,
and the heart's sorrowful remarks.
APTER ONE
o live it hurries and to feel it hastes.
ince Vyazemski

“My uncle has most honest principles:
when he was taken gravely ill,
he forced one to respect him
 and nothing better could invent.
To others his example is a lesson;
but, good God, what a bore to sit
by a sick person day and night, not stirring
 a step away!
What base perfidiousness
to entertain one half-alive,
adjust for him his pillows,
 sadly serve him his medicine,
sigh — and think inwardly
when will the devil take you?”

 Thus a young scapegrace thought
as with post horses in the dust he flew,
by the most lofty will of Zeus
 the heir of all his kin.
Friends of Lyudmila and Ruslan!
The hero of my novel,
without preambles, forthwith,
 I'd like to have you meet:
Onegin, a good pal of mine,
was born upon the Neva's banks,
where maybe you were born,
 or used to shine, my reader!
There formerly I too promenaded —
but harmful is the North to me.1
